### Description

This plugin integrates a convenient panel into the Atlassian JIRA task viewing interface, providing detailed information on task status transitions. The panel displays the history of status changes, including the dates and times of transitions, the names of the users who made these changes, and the time elapsed between each transition. This functionality offers a deeper understanding of task management processes and enhances transparency in project management.

### Plugin Installation

1. To install the plugin, navigate to the "Atlassian Marketplace" page via the link: <https://marketplace.atlassian.com>
2. Search for the "Transition Info" plugin by "ALS Development".
3. Click the "Try it free" button to start a free trial period.
4. For manual installation, download the plugin in the "Versions" section.

### Usage

After installing the plugin, a new section called "Transition Info" will appear in the task viewing interface. If there is no transition history for a task, the plugin will display a message indicating the absence of data. As soon as a status transition is made, the information about this change will immediately appear in the section.

The plugin provides the following information:

* **Transition**: Visually displays information about the change in task statuses.
* **User**: Shows details about the user who performed the transition.
* **Date and Time of Transition**: Provides the exact date and time of the transition.
* **Time Between Transitions**: Calculates and displays the time interval between consecutive transitions.

This is an updated and more structured version of your instructions, aimed at providing clearer understanding of the process for installing and using the plugin.
